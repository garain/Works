# Machine Learning Metrics Visualizer App

This is a machine learning metrics visualizer tool for binary and multi-class classification of data.
For Binary classification, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve and Precision Recall curves can be visualized. 
For multi-class classification, only Confusion Matrix can be visualized.

## App link

[Link to app](https://garain.vision/Authentication/mlvisualize)

## Guidelines if facing problems to open site

The app uses one heroku dyno, so it faces loading issues sometimes. Once you go to the site, and it shows connecting, but doesn't open after 15 to 20s, then simply reload the site. Once it shows connecting, open some other pre-opened tab of the browser window. Then come back to the site after 5 to 6 secs. It will open by then.

## Algorithms supported

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Random Forest
4. Nearest Neighbors
5. Decision Tree 
6. Neural Net(MLP)
7. AdaBoost(Decision Tree Classifier kernel) 
8. Naive Bayes
9. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA)

## Working
1. Upload a .csv file.
2. The 1st column should contain the labels and every column should have a header. 
3. Select any one of the algorithms.
4. Select hyperparameters according to your choice.
5. Select any one metric at a time to display. (Only one at a time)
6. Press classify.
7. The label column should have heading 'type'.

## Raw data
To view your data select "Show Raw data" option.

## Default
By default UCL mushrooms dataset is loaded.



# Clustering Methods
Made a new clustering algorithm based on K-Means algorithm published in Procedia Computer Science Journal named K-RMS Algorithm.
This is the web app created as an implementation of the publication "K-RMS Algorithm" that uses **Flask** and **Gunicorn** for deploying.
If we want to deploy our project to Heroku, we need a **Web Server Gateway Interface** (WSGI) such as **Gunicorn**.

## App link
[Link to app](https://garain.vision/Authentication/clusteringKRMS)

## Usage of the app
By default if any file with wrong file format is provided, the results shown as output are calculated on the Iris dataset.

Specificatons of the file:

1. 1st row should have data headings, i.e., column headings.
2. The last column should contain the corresponding data labels in an ascending order starting from index 1 (N.B. The number of clusters is calculated using this column.
3. File should be strictly in .csv format.
4. File size should be <=600 KB.

## Output
Dictionary with Accuracy and Clusters centroids alongwith a message showing number of iterations and lowest and highest errors.

# GitSub

#### Create GitHub Resource Download Link

With this tool you can directly download or create download link to any GitHub **public directory or file**.

### Website

[GitSub â†‘](https://garain.vision/Authentication/gitsub)

##### Advanced Usage

A typical download URL will look like this- `https://gitsub.garain.vision/#/home?url=<link>&fileName=<name>&rootDirectory=<true or false or name>`

Now, if you want to download this directory- **`https://github.com/garain/GitSub/tree/master/res/images`** with this file name- **`DownGit-Images.zip`** and this root directory name- **`ImagesOfDownGit`**, then the URL will be- https://gitsub.garain.vision/#/home?url=https://github.com/garain/GitSub/tree/master/res/images&fileName=DownGit-Images&rootDirectory=ImagesOfDownGit

In default, value of `fileName` and `rootDirectory` is set to the name of the downloading file or directory. If you do not want to add the directory itself in the zip, then set `rootDirectory=false`. Like: this link- https://gitsub.garain.vision/#/home?url=https://github.com/garain/GitSub/tree/master/res/images&rootDirectory=false, will download a file named **`images.zip`**; however the root directory- `"images"`, will not be included in the zip.

If you want to download file- **`https://github.com/garain/GitSub/blob/master/res/images/downgit.png`** with name- **`DownGitIcon.zip`**, then the link will be- https://gitsub.garain.vision/#/home?url=https://github.com/garain/GitSub/blob/master/res/images/downgit.png&fileName=DownGitIcon

# Voice Note App
### Converting from Speech to Text with JavaScript

The purpose of this app is to experiment with the Web Speech API which enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech), and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.)

This app uses the Web Speech API to build a voice powered note app to do 3 things:

 - Takes notes by using voice-to-text or keyboard input.
 - Save voice notes to localStorage.
 - Display all of the saved notes and give the option to either Listen to the Notes or delete them.

<br>

[Link to App - Click Here](https://garain.vision/Authentication/voicenotes) - __Best Used with Chrome__

__Note:__ On Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based recognition engine. Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won't work offline.
<br>

Most APIs that require user permission don't work on non-secure hosts. Make sure you are serving your Web Speech apps over HTTPS.

### Description

The Web Speech API provides two distinct areas of functionality â€” speech recognition, and speech synthesis (also know as text to speech, or tts) 

The Voice Note App will be separated into two seperate interfaces. The first will be the __"Speech Recognition"__ that will involve receiving speech through a device's microphone, which is then checked by a speech recognition service against a list of grammar (basically, the vocabulary you want to have recognised in a particular app.) When a word or phrase is successfully recognised, it is returned as a result (or list of results) as a text string, and further actions can be initiated as a result.

The second is __"Speech Synthesis"__ (aka text-to-speech, or tts) that involves receiving synthesising text contained within an app to speech, and playing it out of a device's speaker or audio output connection.

### How to Use This App

### Add A New Voice or Text Note
1. â€‹Click on the Start Recognition Button and give the app permission to use your microphone, and start speaking your note (if no microphone or you don't want to use the microphone you can type into the text box.)

2. â€‹When done speaking click on the "Pause Recognition" button, and then click the "Save Note" button. (if you you typed your note in to the text box you do not need to click on the "Pause Recognition" button, just click the "Save Note" button.) 
<br>

----

### Listen To Notes
1. Click on the "Listen to Note" link next to the date of the note that you want to listen to.
<br>

----

### Delete Voice Notes
1. Click on the "Delete" link next to the date of the note that you want to delete.
